# In this program we will learn how a 
# loop works.

# A loop is the same as saying:
# "Run 3 times around the table"
# A loop has 2 parts, What and how many
# times.
# Therefore in this example, the what is
# "Running around the table"
# The how many times is 
# 3

# Task: Make the program dispay
# "Standing up" 10 times.
